## Download SynopFrame

1. Download the whole folder from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xbYeDMVUeccxr5n-9Xho-QC8C8CZ5kiX?usp=sharing
2. In case you get one zip file (in my case `SynopSpace-20230101T075137Z-001`) and a standalone file (`trajectory_run_aligned_to_mean.oxdna-002.dat`)
    - unzip the compressed file
    - rename `trajectory_run_aligned_to_mean.oxdna-002.dat` to `trajectory_run_aligned_to_mean.oxdna.dat` (make sure your file explorer shows the file extensions)
    - move `trajectory_run_aligned_to_mean.oxdna.dat` to `SynopSpace\demo_cube\input`
3.
