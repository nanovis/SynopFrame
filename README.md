# Hardware 

Currently only tested on Windows and Mac. A low-end gaming laptop (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, Intel Core i3-8100 CPU @ 3.60GHz, 16GB RAM) maintains an interactive frame rate. A high-end MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019, Intel Core i9, 32GB RAM) cannot maintain an interactive frame rate, so we do not recommend users to try SynopFrame on Mac. We believe a Linux machine with a decent graphics card should work well. 

# Installation

Windows installation [guide](https://github.com/nanovis/SynopFrame/blob/main/Install-Win.md). 

For Linux users, the installation process should be similar to Windows. We are happy to guide you through the process. 

# Input 

To run SynopFrame for your own dataset, you need to create a folder with the following contents.
